Update:
This project is being rebuilt from scratch at: https://github.com/BrianP8701/swarmstarv2


** old **

This package is not ready to be used yet.

I'm currently working on building a product because i need to make money (im a 19 yr old dropout), so i cant build swarmstar rn. ill still touch up on it a little to use it to create a memory metadata tree over my product, have like a hyper personalized Devin for my application. but ill manually be piecing together the memory metadata tree. i suppose this is good. itll let me focus on the action side of swarmstar, and let me battle test it to actually help me build a product. but in the future im definitely going to return to this, and create the implementation to have swarmstar actually manage and control its own memory.
