what to do as the "intelligence" of models -> ?

computers and current models are already superhuman at many things. As they approach us in other things we find ourselves in a new world.

for all of history the most important thing has been to be a leader, because to have as much power as possible you need to employ others to help you in your mission.

as models approach (and surpass?) humans in intelligence, to accomplish your mission you dont want to waste your time aligning and working with humans. the modern model of a company goes out the window. Instead of running a company, everyone controls and maintains their own swarm. Rather than capitalism letting humans compete for money to employ more humans, humans control their swarms and compete to get more compute, energy, raw materials and intelligence to add to their swarm.
