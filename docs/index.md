what happens to society as the "intelligence" of models increase?

for all of history the most important thing has been to be a leader. because to have the best shot at achieving your goal you need to employ others to help you

if models surpass humans in "intelligence" theres a better option than trying to align humans with your goal. today's idea of a company goes out the window if ais surpass humans. Instead of running a company, you'd control and maintain an agi system. 

Instead of having **companies** compete for money to **employ** more humans, **humans** compete for money to **grow** their agi systems to achieve their personal goals

swarmstar is my agi system. its built using a foundational model, whatevers best at the time. thats gpt4 today. im trying to future proof, so in the future i can utilize the best models and technologies that arise

maybe swarmstar will never become useful in which case it doesent matter. but if it does, I want to always keep it fully open

my lifelong goal is to solve aging or achieve stasis with reliable revival, and the best way i see to do that is to accelerate progress
