what to do as the "intelligence" of models -> ?

for all of history the most important thing has been to be a leader, because to have as much power as possible to achieve your goal you need to employ others to help you

as models approach (and surpass?) humans in "intelligence" you dont want to waste your time aligning and working with humans to accomplish your mission. today's idea of a company goes out the window if ais surpass humans. Instead of running a company, you'd control and maintain ais, or, a "swarm". 

Rather than capitalism letting humans compete for money to employ more humans, humans control their swarms and compete for money to upgrade and grow their swarms to achieve their goals

swarmstar is my swarm architecture. i tried to design swarmstar to be as resilient as possible, useful no matter how "smart" models get

maybe swarmstar will never become useful in which case it doesent matter. but if it does, I commit to keeping swarmstar fully open

my lifelong goal is to solve aging or achieve stasis with reliable revival, and the best way i see to do that is to accelerate progress
