# Swarm History
## What is the swarm history?
The swarm history allows us to see how the swarm got to it's current state. It's a list of all the swarm operations and the corresponding node that performed it in chronological order.

We can use this to backtrack and debug, move back in time and see each step of the swarm's lifecycle.
