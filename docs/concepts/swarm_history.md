# Swarm History
The swarm is broken up into discrete "[swarm operations](swarm_operations/index.md)". The swarm history stores all swarm operations that have already been performed. 

    Note: It is up to the user to decide how to handle the swarm operations that are waiting to be executed. I left this blank so you may choose to adopt a method that suits your preferences and scale.
