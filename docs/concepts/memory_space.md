# Memory Space
## What is the memory space?
The memory space contains the predefined memory that comes with the swarm, such as documentation to understand itself when it needs to dynamically create an action. It's also a place to store the swarm's work and thoughts during execution. For example, if the swarm is writing code, creating new actions or retrieving data from the internet it will store it here. 

This space is organized similarly to the [Action Space](action_space.md). There is a Memory Metadata Space which contains metadata for folders and memories so the swarm can navigate and add memories autonomously. A router can search the space for the relevant memories it needs, or when adding memories to the memory space a router will navigate the memory space to find the best place to store a memory, potentially creating new folders.
