# Failure operations
## What is a failure operation?
Failure Operations can come from many places. Ther might be an actual mistake with the swarm's code, invalid data, or the swarm might encounter a task that it can't perform. The Failure Operation contains all the relevant information and the swarm will attempt to fix the failure itself, or contact the user.
