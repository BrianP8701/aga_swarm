# TODO List

## 12/23/23 - 1/18/24
- [x] have swarm write github wrapper
- [x] Create user assistance agent and integrate with python coder and manger (router is simpler, just has user choose next action instead of the complex interaction with the user assistance agent)
- [x] Add initial python script tester agent
- [ ] Add terminate algo
- [ ] Add web scraper
- [x] Add place to hold documentation
- [ ] Get v2 run to work in all components
- [ ] Change descriptions in node_scripts
- [ ] Remember theres a temp stitch in break_down_goal with is_parallel cuz im not sure how to handle it yet
- [ ] Fix snapshot save its not working
- [ ] Add system to download dependencies. Add dependency requirements to each script, chunk of code etc
- [ ] Line 54 in agents.json enum shit
- [ ] Create custom namespace for task handler

So a lot of the goals outlined above have actually been rendered irrelevant because ive changed the architecture and inner workings of the swarm so much. im just gonna renew the todo list below

- [ ] add retrieval agent
